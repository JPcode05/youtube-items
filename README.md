# youtube-pre-2017-unlisted-items
This was a repository where [Archive Team](https://archiveteam.org/) managed items for youtube-grab during the event where YouTube was about to set pre-2017 unlisted videos to private.

This is a frozen archive of the repository with those original items. You can scan for video IDs and metadata, then search on the Internet Archive for those videos.
